# About these sample JSON files

These files are directly generated from the TEAM interface views. While the views work well enough when used to directly generate ETL against, they are not suited as a message format.

They should only be considered as a starting point for discussion, since the content of metadata should contain everything required to generate ETL and table structures. In other words: it's just the format that needs to change for the purpose of a common information exchange interface.

To clarify, these extracts are made from the interface of TEAM - not the underlying metadata model itself. The idea is here that the TEAM model is developed for the purposes of supporting the TEAM application, and that the interface which is the topic of this Github is independent from TEAM - and can be shared between multiple applications and use-cases.

For reference, the underlying metadata model that TEAM uses can be viewed here: https://app.sqldbm.com/SQLServer/Share/xdwwuNcV1SLytr8SsGu4iUGFrngIE8md_DYjF4jNYw0
