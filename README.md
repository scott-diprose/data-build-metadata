# dp-metadata

Metadata to describes processes within a data pipeline.

The canonical model is provided as a JSON Schema.

## WIP

At the moment only the schema for mapping data between data models/stores has been added, and so is marked as mandatory in the root schema. As other useful metadata is identified and modelled. Then this will not continue to be the case, and the root schema will only hold optional objects as root elements for each type.
